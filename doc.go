// Package doc
// go get -u github.com/sesky4/tgo
// package github.com/sesky4/tgo: no Go files in /Users/xxx/go/src/github.com/sesky4/tgo
// FIXME: this is a workaround for above go get issue, a fake file does nothing but claims we are a go project.
// Eventually we need something useful here, such as real documentation, version and etc.
// To get the package of all products at once, the package of each product is added in the imports code as side-effects.
